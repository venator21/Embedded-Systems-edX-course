# Embedded-Systems-edX-course
"Microcontroller Input/Output" Embedded Systems course from edX platform - March 2020

This repository include .c files for each lab of the course. All labs were graded 100% by course software. During the course I was working with [Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit that has an ARM Cortex-M4 processor](http://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). 



[E-Book](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/) - To quickly look up course syllabus you can look up this site, which is a transcript of the course (up to chapter 10).
